# p2psim-core

This is based on the peernet simulator by Spyros Voulgaris available here: https://github.com/PeerNet/PeerNet

This isolates the main components of the peernet simulator with modifications to increase its modularity, namely by supporting user defined simulation engines, and user defined heap structures for event-based simulation engines.

The original Peernet simulator is based on the Peersim simulator available here: http://peersim.sourceforge.net/

This project is being conducted by the NOVA-SYS research group (https://novasys.di.fct.unl.pt/) of the NOVA LINCS laboratory (https://nova-lincs.di.fct.unl.pt/) from the NOVA School of Science and Technology (https://www.fct.unl.pt/en/about-fct/overview) in Portugal.
