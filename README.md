# peernet-core

This is based on the peernet simulator by Spyros Voulgaris available here: https://github.com/PeerNet/PeerNet

This isolates the main components of the peernet simulator with modifications to increase its modularity, namely by supporting user defined simulation engines, and user defined heap structures for event-based simulation engines.

The original Peernet simulator is based on the Peersim simulator available here: http://peersim.sourceforge.net/
